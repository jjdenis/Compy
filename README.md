# The Compy Project
This is my personal project to make a programming learning environment,
with the look and feel of old Commodore systems.

Compy still doesn't run on Windows and I haven't tested it on linux.

It runs using wxwindows, which I have installed on my mac using the Anaconda distribution.

This is a sample of the screen

To run without installation
-----------------------------

  pythonw draw_line.py


To install the program:
------------------------
  pip install --editable . (on Os X)

Installing the program enables you to run it from everywhere, making it very useful for the examples and challenges

I'm very new to setuptools, so I have done my best,
and help would be appreciated with the packging and installing.



Examples and challenges can be found here:
