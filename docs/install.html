<h1>Installation</h1>

To install Compy you need these things:
<ul>
    <item> Python 2.7 running in your system (to check if you have it, open a terminal and type 'python',
       it should open a python console </item>
    <item> A python library called WxPython, check if you have it typing import wx in the python console</item>
    <item> Some other python libraries: jinja2, </item>
    <item> The Compy program </item>
</ul>

<p>To run compy, just open a terminal in the compy directory and type: </p>

<p> Important: If you don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry,
    just find someone who is more into computers and ask him or her
    to set thing up for you </p>
