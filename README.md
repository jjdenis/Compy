# The Compy Project

This is my personal project to make a programming learning environment,
with the look and feel of old Commodore systems.

Compy still doesn't run on Windows and I haven't tested it on linux.

It runs using wxWindows, which I have installed on my mac using the Anaconda distribution.

This is a sample of the screen
